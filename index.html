    <div class="bubble-content">Vcu Purchased Mansion Nightclub for 3.5 Million Dollars, about four times its estimated value.  This was after multiple attempts to have the primarily black-attended nightclub shut down, or halt business.  This was also during a time where VCU adjunct professors were pleading to the administration for more livable wages.
     <br>
    The University is still unsure what the venue will be turned into, but as for now, it will collect dust; a hollow husk of the culture that Grace street held separate from the institution.
